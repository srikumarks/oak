A toy js framework for instructional purposes.

If you follow the sequence of commit and the commit messages, you can
follow the evolution of the "framework" as a series of choices made
in the design of a Javascript function that bears close resemblance
to the HTML that it produces and, more importantly, maintains.

- Play with the traditional [TodoMVC example].
- Checkout the [TodoMVC source] code (ported from Elm's version).
- Efficient updating is achieved using "model diffing".
- Includes a "by copy" implementation of immutable structs.
- Inspired by [Elm], but in plain JS.
